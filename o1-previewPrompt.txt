A modern smartphone has magnetometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope. These sensors play crucial roles in various phone functions and applications. Let me break them down for you:

Magnetometer:
The magnetometer measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields. In smartphones, it's primarily used as a digital compass.

Concept: It contains tiny sensors that detect the Earth's magnetic field. By measuring the magnetic field's strength in three dimensions, the phone can determine its orientation relative to the Earth's magnetic north.
Uses: Navigation apps, augmented reality applications, and determining the phone's orientation.

Accelerometer:
The accelerometer measures the rate of change in the velocity of the phone - in other words, its acceleration.

Concept: It typically uses tiny springs or weights that move when the phone accelerates. The movement is converted into electrical signals, which the phone interprets as motion data.
Uses: Detecting screen rotation, step counting in fitness apps, motion-controlled games, and stabilizing camera footage.

Gyroscope:
The gyroscope measures the phone's angular velocity - how quickly it's rotating and in which direction.

Concept: It usually employs vibrating elements that experience a force (known as the Coriolis effect) when rotated. This force is measured and translated into rotation data.
Uses: More precise motion sensing for games, image stabilization in cameras, and enhanced motion tracking for augmented and virtual reality applications.
These sensors often work together to provide more accurate and comprehensive motion and orientation data. For example, combining accelerometer and gyroscope data can give a more precise picture of how the phone is moving in three-dimensional space.

Out of these, which sensor is invarient of the device and only depends on external factors. The reason I ask this is because I met a clent who has a requirement for the construction industry. He wants the workers to use mobile to send photos of the components assigned to them. He wants them to take photos at a particular angle or a range of angles at a particular location. The company is a engineering and contractor company with construction projects. The project has sites and the sites have components. The engineers know the details of the components (pillars, road blocks, bridge slabs etc.) like coordinates and angles. The workers are assigned to work on the components and send photo/s at a particular angle defined. For reference, this is the schema of the component in the backend: 
import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from 'mongoose';
import { IPhoto } from './Photo';
export interface IComponent extends Document {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  site: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  status: string;
  progress: number;
  coordinates: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    z: number;
  };
  requiredAngle: number;
  photos: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[] | IPhoto[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
const ComponentSchema: Schema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  site: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Site', required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['Planned', 'In Progress', 'Completed'], default: 'Planned' },
  progress: { type: Number, min: 0, max: 100, default: 0 },
  coordinates: {
    x: { type: Number, required: true },
    y: { type: Number, required: true },
    z: { type: Number, required: true },
  },
  requiredAngle: { type: Number, required: true },
  photos: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Photo' }]
}, { timestamps: true });
ComponentSchema.virtual('photoCount').get(function() {
  return this.photos.length;
});
export default mongoose.model<IComponent>('Component', ComponentSchema);

Given the client's requirement for workers to take photos at specific angles, the magnetometer offers several advantages:

Consistent Reference: The Earth's magnetic field provides a stable reference point across different devices and locations.
Angle Measurement: By comparing the device's orientation to magnetic north, the app can calculate the angle at which the photo is being taken.
Independence from Motion: Unlike the accelerometer and gyroscope, the magnetometer's readings are not affected by the worker's movement, only the device's orientation.

Implementation Considerations

Angle Calculation: The requiredAngle field in the Component schema could represent the angle relative to magnetic north.
Tolerance Range: Implement a tolerance range for the required angle to account for slight variations in handheld devices.
Calibration: Include a magnetometer calibration step in the app to ensure accuracy across different devices.
Combining Sensors: While the magnetometer is primary, combining it with accelerometer data can provide more accurate orientation information, especially for determining the device's tilt.

To solve this problem, I wrote code for the mobile phone as a POC.

Key points about this implementation:

It uses both Accelerometer and Magnetometer data to calculate the world-relative orientation.
The calculateWorldOrientation function performs the necessary calculations to derive azimuth and elevation relative to the world coordinate system.
This approach should provide consistent readings regardless of how the phone is rotated, as long as it's pointing in the same direction.

This solution addresses the issue I observed:

When you rotate the phone 180 degrees, the azimuth should remain approximately the same (allowing for some sensor noise) as long as the camera is pointing in the same direction.
The elevation will change to reflect the new tilt of the device relative to the ground.

This implementation is more complex but provides a true world-relative orientation, which should be much more suitable for your use case in the construction industry.
